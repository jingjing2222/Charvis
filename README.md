This project is an interactive system to prevent driver drowsiness. It uses an infrared camera and a CO2 sensor to detect drowsiness levels by monitoring the driver's face, behavior, and CO2 levels. Depending on the drowsiness level, it starts a conversation, guides the driver to a rest area, or emits an alert to keep the driver awake.
